# Roblox-Namesnipe-Finder

Roblox-Namesnipe-Finder is a console application that will take a word, generate variations of the word, and then check to see which combos are valid and returns them to you.

Installation:
Download either the Windows 10 x86 release or the Linux ARM release.
Save the exe to a place where you can find it again.
Run the exe and it will ask you for a word to check.

Note:
This is my first project in Go and also my first public repository on Github.
