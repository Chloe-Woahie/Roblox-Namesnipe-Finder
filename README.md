# Roblox-Namesnipe-Finder

Roblox-Namesnipe-Finder is a console application that will take a word, generate variations of the word, and then check to see which names are valid and returns them to you.

Installation:

`cd src/Checker`

`go build`

`sudo mv ./Roblox-Namesnipe-Finder /usr/local/bin/Roblox-Namesnipe-Finder`

Note:
This is my first project in Go and also my first public repository on Github.

Update:
I have created a discord bot that uses this system.
The invite link for one of the servers is https://discord.gg/tPFdYanW5t
Example:
